Method Resolution Order (MRO)
Whenever you create a class, Python sets a Method Resolution Order, or MRO, for that class, which is the order in which Python will look for methods on instances of that class.
You can programmatically reference the MRO three ways:
• mro_ attribute on the class
• use the mro) method onhhe class
• use the builtin help(cls) method
